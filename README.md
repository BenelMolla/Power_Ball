## Power_Ball
#### THIS PROJECT SHOWS ALL STEPS THAT HOW DOES THE POWERBALL GAME WORK

> The Power Ball Game Includes Two Parts.
    
  * Part One Includes 5 Numbers. These Five Numbers Are White Ball Numbers, Which Are Drawn Randomly From 20 Numbers From 1 to 20 inclusively -(1,2,3,4,5, ...,17,18,19,20).

  * Part Two Only Has One Number, The PowerBall Number, Which Is Obtained Randomly From 10 Numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).
  * When The Program/page Is Run Or Reload /Refreshed, It Would Display Today's PowerBall Winning Numbers, Your Lucky Numbers, And Display The Result Based On Your Lucky Numbers Against Today's PowerBall Winning Numbers.
